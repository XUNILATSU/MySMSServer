Make sure to put okhttp.jar in the libs folder at the same level as src/ & build/ so...
MyServer/app/build/
MyServer/app/libs/OKhttp
MyServer/app/src/ ** source code **

Select import OKhttp as libraray this is the most basic usage there are others with broadcastlistenerclasses with added encryption, we will get there
